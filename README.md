# Intsy
32/64 channel bioamplifier system

Intsy is a new low-cost, open-source, wireless-enabled bioamplifier system.  The system can be configured for 32 or 64 channel operation.  Data can be streamed either wirelessly via bluetooth or in wired configuration over USB.  A LabView interface allows for real-time visualization and saving to hard disk for off-line analysis.  Data rates of 32 chan x 110 Hz can be stably transmitted over bluetooth.  The USB wired configuration can achieve up to 2 kHz x 32 chan.  

The name Intsy comes from the two core components: Intan RHD2132 bioamplifier chip + Teensy 3.2 microcontroller.

Feedback and suggestions are warmly welcomed!
