# Intsy
32/64 channel bioamplifier system

Intsy is a new low-cost, open-source, wireless-enabled bioamplifier system.  The system can be configured for 32 or 64 channel operation.  It has been validated for gastrointesinal slow wave recordings and surface EMG.  

Data can be streamed either wirelessly via bluetooth or in wired configuration over USB.  A LabView interface allows for real-time visualization and saving to hard disk for off-line analysis.  Data rates of 32 chan x 110 Hz can be stably transmitted over bluetooth.  The USB wired configuration can achieve up to 2 kHz x 32 chan.  

The name Intsy comes from the two core components: Intan RHD2132 bioamplifier chip + Teensy 3.2 microcontroller.

Please see "Intsy_GettingStarted.pdf" for details instructions on how to set up the Intsy system.
