# Intsy
32/64 channel bioamplifier system

Intsy is a new low-cost, open-source, wireless-enabled bioamplifier system.  The system can be configured for 32 or 64 channel operation.  It has been validated for gastrointesinal slow wave recordings and surface EMG.  

Data can be streamed either wirelessly via bluetooth or in wired configuration over USB.  A LabView interface allows for real-time visualization and saving to hard disk for off-line analysis.  Data rates of 32 chan x 110 Hz can be stably transmitted over bluetooth.  The USB wired configuration can achieve up to 2 kHz x 32 chan.  

The name Intsy comes from the two core components: Intan RHD2132 bioamplifier chip + Teensy 3.2 microcontroller.

Please see "Intsy_GettingStarted.pdf" for details instructions on how to set up the Intsy system. Assembly time is typically about 2-4 hrs.  Total cost is about $1400 for the 32 channel system and about $2300 for the 64 channel system.  That means in just half a day you can build your very own high-quality, low-cost, portable bioamplifier system!

Feedback and suggestions are warmly welcomed!
